== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why make a plugin / widget to search on Experts Exchange?  
*   This was done upon request from the community.

Why can't I add this widget?  
*   Do you have a theme that is compatible with widgets? If not, there are many easy to follow tutorials on how to make your theme widget compatible. Check with your favorite search engine.

What version of Wordpress is required to run this?

Why doesn't the widget look right?
