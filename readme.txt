== Description ==

This plugin creates a widget which provides a basic search form to submit a query at http://experts-exchange.com.

There are two CSS files included with the plugin which you may edit as desired. Reset.css SHOULD remove all
CSS influences coming form your theme. Emphasis on SHOULD.

Styles.css styles this widget after the reset.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why make a plugin / widget to search on Experts Exchange? =

= Why can't I add this widget =

Do you have a theme that is compatible with widgets? If not, there are many easy to follow tutorials on how to make
your theme widget compatible. Check with your favorite search engine.

Did you activate the plugin?

Did you place the widget?

= What version of Wordpress is required to run this? =

In all honesty, I have no idea. It's been tested as working on Wordpress 3.0.1. Other versions are likely to work.

= Why doesn't the widget look right? =

Your theme's CSS might be interfering with the plugin's included CSS. Feel free to edit the CSS files as needed.
